          Sending messages across WhatsApp, email and individual texts is
          tedious to manage. Altra`s communication hub allows you to send group
          or individual messages via SMS that convert to 1:1 conversations.

          Never second-guess whether your message has been read. Easily track
          engagement rates and responses in one place.

          We know that rosters are constantly changing. Now managers can stay
          ahead of these changes and act when inevitable vacancies occur. Fill
          shifts in two easy steps:

        <p className={styles.content}>
          Altraâ€™s simple user experience makes communication between managers
          and team a breeze. By streamlining previously manual processes, we are
